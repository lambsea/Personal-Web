										</header>
										<p>"Hi, I'm Zhuowen Wang, an aspiring business analyst with a focus on leveraging data to drive business strategy and outcomes. With a Master's degree in Applied Analytics from Columbia University and a B.B.A in Economics from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, I have honed my analytical and statistical skills.

I'm adept at Python, SQL, R, and data visualization tools like Tableau. My projects span diverse domains such as market sizing, brand strategy, and predictive modeling. I'm actively looking for entry-level positions in business analytics, preferably in the consulting industry. I pride myself on being a proactive problem solver, detail-oriented, and an excellent team player."</p>
